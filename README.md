# Streamlit Aviation Risk Modeling Dashboard

## Overview

This repository contains a Streamlit-based Aviation Risk Modeling Dashboard that analyzes aviation incidents, evaluates risk scores, and simulates potential financial losses using Monte Carlo simulations. The goal is to provide an interactive tool for aviation insurance analysts, actuaries, and risk management professionals.

## Features

- âœ… Data Visualization â€“ Analyze aviation incidents, weather conditions, and aircraft types using interactive plots.
- âœ… Risk Scoring Model â€“ Calculate risk scores based on aviation incidents and fatalities.
- âœ… Monte Carlo Simulation â€“ Predict potential financial losses using stochastic modeling.
- âœ… Streamlit Web App â€“ Deploy and interact with the dashboard in real-time.

## Live Demo

You can try the live demo hosted on Streamlit Cloud: [ðŸ”— Streamlit App](https://app-aviation-dashboard.streamlit.app/)
